    "As we learned yesterday, machines cannot interpret raw text. We need to transform that text into something we/machines can more readily analyze. Yesterday, we did simple counts of counts to summarize the content of Amazon reviews. Today, we'll extend those concepts to talk about vector representations such as Bag of Words (BoW) and word embedding models. We'll use those representations for search, visualization, and prepare for our classification day tomorrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Processing text data to prepare it for machine learning models often means translating the information from documents into a numerical format. Bag-of-Words approaches (sometimes referred to as Frequency-Based word embeddings) accomplish this by \"vectorizing\" tokenized documents. This is done by representing each document as a row in a DataFrame and creating a column for each unique word in the corpora (group of documents). The presence or lack of a given word in a document is then represented either as a raw count of how many times a given word appears in a document (CountVectorizer) or as that word's TF-IDF score (TfidfVectorizer).\n",

On language tasks like question answering, reading comprehension, summarization, and translation, GPT-2 begins to learn these tasks from the raw text, using no task-specific training data.

      "b'UK net users leading TV downloads\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under, appear on the web hours after they are shown in the US, said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent, the firm said. \"It\\'s now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR,\" said Ben Coppin from Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said the report, and an estimated 20,000 of those were from within the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nFans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK. But in some cases, said the report, people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country. \"Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet,\" explained Mr Coppin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect, the internet is now a global video recorder.\" Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode, others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term \"time-shifting\" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders, TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+, have also contributed to the trend. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin half an hour, recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because they tend to be shorter then full-length films, they can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The BBC ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year, which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. About six million people in the UK now have a fast, always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.\\r\\n'\n"

       "b'Ink helps drive democracy in Asia\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kyrgyz Republic, a small, mountainous state of the former Soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country\\'s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. In an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as \"an island of democracy\", the Kyrgyz President, Askar Akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections. The US government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003, reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. The use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the German Embassy, the Soros Foundation and the Kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. The ink is sprayed on a person\\'s left thumb. It dries and is not visible under normal light.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. At the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter\\'s fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. Likewise, any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. These elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the Autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former Soviet Republics, notably Ukraine and Georgia. The use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.\\r\\n\\r\\nWidely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. The greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. Local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful, radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. Others, such as the aggressively middle of the road, Coalition of Non-governmental Organizations, have lauded the move as an important step forward. This type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as Serbia, South Africa, Indonesia and Turkey. The other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in Afghanistan showed, improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. The use of \"invisible\" ink is not without its own problems. In most elections, numerous rumors have spread about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Serbia, for example, both Christian and Islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. Other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink - various soft drinks, solvents and cleaning products are put forward. However, in reality, the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. The ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week. The use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. The passage of the inking law is, nevertheless, a clear step forward towards free and fair elections.\" The country\\'s widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 February.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Mikosz works for the IFES, an international, non-profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies.\\r\\n'"

Stephen Toulouse, a security manager at Microsoft, said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment. Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. Earlier this week, Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software. Microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet set a date for its release. The anti-spyware program being targeted is currently only in beta form and aims to help users find and remove spyware - programs which monitor internet use, causes advert pop-ups and slow a PC's performance.\\r\\n\""

       "b'Apple laptop is \\'greatest gadget\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first \"lightweight\" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs. The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. The magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a \"self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In general we included only items that were potentially mobile,\" said the magazine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget,\" it concluded. The oldest \"gadget\" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place. Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia), as well as the first \"successful\" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac). The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13.\\r\\n\\r\\nSony\\'s third entry in the top 20 is the CDP-101 CD player from 1983. \"Who can forget the crystalline, hiss-free blast of Madonna\\'s Like A Virgin emenating from their first CD player?\" asked the magazine. Karl Elsener\\'s knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list. Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th), 1980s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy worry about mobile phones. Soon they will be subsumed into the PDA\\'s / laptops etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about the Marine Chronometer? Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. For it\\'s time, a technological marvel!\\r\\n\\r\\nSony Net Minidisc! It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. I always used my NetMD, and could not go anywhere without it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA laptop computer is not a gadget! It\\'s a working tool!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sinclair Executive was the world\\'s first pocket calculator. I think this should be there as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or a pocket calculator? All these things are useful to real people, not just PC magazine editors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre the people who created this list insane ? Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone? It has revolutionalised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHas everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker??\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interesting list. Of the electronic gadgets, thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100. The size of A4 paper and light, three weeks on a set of batteries, an excellent keyboard, a modem. A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s an Apple Powerbook 100 ? It\\'s out of date - not much of a \"gadget\". Surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener, Swiss Army Knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves ?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has to be the mobile phone. No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. A true gadget, it could be carried around and shown off.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. I say this as the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20.\\r\\n\\r\\nSinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time. The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS. Shame the marketing was so bad!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nApple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nUtter rubbish. Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets. But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer \\'gadgets\\' and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. No competition.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d also put Apple\\'s Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason. I only wish that Vulcan Inc\\'s Flipstart wasn\\'t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)? What about radios and TVs?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swiss army knife. By far the most useful gadget. I got mine 12 years ago. Still wearing and using it a lot! It stood the test of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nPsion Organiser series 3, should be up there. Had a usable qwerty keyboard, removable storage, good set of apps and programmable. Case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first, I think). Great product innovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile PC?! Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site? It\\'s obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Motorola Startac should be Number One. Why? There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Psion series 3c! The first most practical way to carry all your info around...\\r\\n\\r\\nI too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d have put the mobile phone high up the list. Probably a Nokia model.\\r\\n\\r\\nSinclair Spectrum - 16k. It plugged into the tv. Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that\\'s what I do for a living now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish more modern notebooks -- even Apple\\'s newest offerings -- were more like the PB100. Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball, which has given way to the largely useless \"trackpad\" which every notebook on the market today uses. They\\'re invariably inaccurate, uncomfortable, and cumbersome to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongratulations to Apple, a deserved win!\\r\\n'"

    "### BoW discards textual context\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the limitations of Bag-of-Words approaches is that any information about the textual context surrounding that word is lost. This also means that with bag-of-words approaches often the only tools that we have for identifying words with similar usage or meaning and subsequently consolidating them into a single vector is through the processes of stemming and lemmatization which tend to be quite limited at consolidating words unless the two words are very close in their spelling or in their root parts-of-speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding approaches preserve more textual context\n",
    "Word2Vec is an increasingly popular word embedding technique. Like Bag-of-words it learns a real-value vector representation for a predefined fixed-size vocabulary that is generated from a corpus of text. However, in contrast to BoW, Word2Vec approaches are much more capable of accounting for textual context, and are better at discovering words with similar meanings or usages (semantic or syntactic similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec Intuition\n",
    "### The Distribution Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how Word2Vec preserves textual context we have to understand what's called the Distribution Hypothesis (Reference: Distribution Hypothesis Theory  -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics. The Distribution Hypothesis operates under the assumption that words that have similar contexts will have similar meanings. Practically speaking, this means that if two words are found to have similar words both to the right and to the left of them throughout the corpora then those words have the same context and are assumed to have the same meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" - John Firth\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we let the usage of a word define its meaning and its \"similarity\" to other words. In the following example, which words would you say have a similar meaning? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 1**: Traffic was light today\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 2**: Traffic was heavy yesterday\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 3**: Prediction is that traffic will be smooth-flowing tomorrow since it is a national holiday\n",

    "Now, can you spot which words have a similar row-vector representation? Hint: Look for values that are repeated in a given column. Each column represents the context that word was found in. If there are multiple words that share a context then those words are understood to have a closer meaning with each other than with other words in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look specifically at the words sunniest and raniest. You'll notice that these two words have exactly the same 10-dimensional vector representation. Based on this very small corpora of text we would conclude that these two words have the same meaning because they share the same usage. Is this a good assumption? Well, they are both referring to the weather outside so that's better than nothing. You could imagine that as our corpora grows larger we will be exposed a greater number of contexts and the Distribution Hypothesis assumption will improve. \n",

    "#### Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "The Skip-Gram method predicts the neighbors’ of a word given a center word. In the skip-gram model, we take a center word and a window of context (neighbors) words to train the model and then predict context words out to some window size for each center word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion of “context” or “neighboring” words is best described by considering a center word and a window of words around it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we consider the sentence **“The speedy Porsche drove past the elegant Rolls-Royce”** and a window size of 2, we’d have the following pairs for the skip-gram model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text:**\n",
    "**The**\tspeedy\tPorsche\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n",
    "\n",

    "The **Skip-gram model** is going to output a probability distribution i.e. the probability of a word appearing in context given a center word and we are going to select the vector representation that maximizes the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "With CountVectorizer and TF-IDF the best we could do for context was to look at common bi-grams and tri-grams (n-grams). Well, skip-grams go far beyond that and give our model much stronger contextual information.\n",

    "## Continuous Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "This model takes thes opposite approach from the skip-gram model in that it tries to predict a center word based on the neighboring words. In the case of the CBOW model, we input the context words within the window (such as “the”, “Proshe”, “drove”) and aim to predict the target or center word “speedy” (the input to the prediction pipeline is reversed as compared to the SkipGram model).\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical depiction of the input to output prediction pipeline for both variants of the Word2vec model is attached. The graphical depiction will help crystallize the difference between SkipGrams and Continuous Bag of Words.\n",

    "## Notable Differences between Word Embedding methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) W2V focuses less document topic-modeling. You'll notice that the vectorizations don't really retain much information about the original document that the information came from. At least not in our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) W2V can result in really large and complex vectorizations. In fact, you need Deep Neural Networks to train your Word2Vec models from scratch, but we can use helpful pretrained embeddings (thank you Google) to do really cool things!\n",
