Background At numo, we create and incubate new \"fintech\" companies. numo seeks a business-minded, results-oriented data scientist who wants to see the insights they derive be put to work in early stage product concepts. The Venture team, which you will be a key member of, sits at the fuzzy front end of the idea pipeline, partnering with internal stakeholders, 3rd-parties and academics to define new product development opportunities in the fintech space. We\\\\\\'re looking for a hands-on data wizard who wants to experiment with new data sources, analyze data, problem solve about how data can be used, develop predictive models, and deploy and maintain these models as they become part of our product portfolio. Our venture team includes product and business experts, and now we\\\\\\'re seeking to build our data science competency in the space. This role will include a combination of: exploring data insights and challenges that go beyond what is common in the financial world today, digging into large, novel datasets to derive trends and insights that will turn into commercializable products, bringing technical and data horsepower to bear as we elevate the work from ambiguous idea to robust prototype. You will be responsible for actually making and coding. The role will be a great fit for someone who is able to derive insights from data, prototype early, make something simple, allow others to test it and gather client feedback soon and often. It\\\\\\'s not necessarily about stewarding a product through to launch but will most often be about going deep early to explore a product or opportunity from all angles with respect to data. What you\\\\\\'ll be doing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 sound interesting? Leverage your deep understanding of data science and modern tech to enhance numo\\\\\\'s early stage product ideas. Work with Venture leadership to ideate and outline project objectives related to data sources and models. Experiment with data, data sources and data models to deliver early stage insights and models that contribute to our products. Utilize your expertise to provide data, modeling and data platform guidance including limitations and opportunities. You will explore the very latest technologies to produce innovative financial products, predictive models, and insights to drive business decisions. What an ideal candidate will bring to the table \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 does this describe you? Thrive in an environment where you\\\\\\'ll work across multiple projects at once Able to work in a fast-paced environment Analytical problem solver who wants to spend time learning about new data sources and technologies and demonstrating value Experienced in working with / analyzing large, complex data sets using tools such as R, Stata, etc. Skilled communicator - able to present to stakeholders when needed. An experienced coder who is passionate about the tech world (and ideally fintech) Able to operate in a lead role developing innovative data-driven ideas Can learn new software and concepts quickly Has high level of knowledge of software implementation Who we are  We are a team of technologists, designers, business thinkers, and academics that create software and data products. We pair opportunities in FinTech with cutting-edge technologies and data analysis. Funded in full by our parent financial institution, we do more with ideas than just talk about them\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94we have the tools and resources necessary to bring them to life. We launch products for a variety of financial institutions and beyond to help them solve compelling pains. What numo offers Competitive salary Cool office space at Bakery Square Opportunity to work on cool new technology Great benefits Note: When applying, we like to see a thoughtful cover letter that addresses our requirements.\\''"
